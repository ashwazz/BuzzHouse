The Best Influencer Marketting Platform 

# OUR IDEA
We want to create a platform that bridges the gap between influencers and  sponsers looking to promote their brands. We want to make it easy for sponsers to find the right influencers and also for influencers to find the right brands they can work with .
 A platform where the influencers know their market value and sponsers know the ROI of working with a creator . To increase the ease and speed with which small buisnesses can find themselves in front of thousands or millions of viewers. 

## THE PROBLEM 
 
### For Brands 

Many small and medium size buinesses like cafes , clothing stores , niche fashion brands or beauty products spend lots of time finding the right influencers . More often than not , they have to do this each time they target a new platform . After finding the influencers , it takes time to settle on the right price for promotion . More often than not , the agreed upon price deviates from the market value . 

### For Influencers

Many influencers have found themselves in trouble for working with the wrong brands by promoting misleading products or services . Early stage Influencers also face trouble finding the brands that are right for them . 
They face troubles in negotiating a price they deserve for thier promotion 

## Pain Points
